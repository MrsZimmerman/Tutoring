	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img src = "pic.jpg" class = "image"> 	
	<p>I grew up in Exeter Township, where I still live today. 
	I am currently a high school computer science teacher in Lancaster County,
	and I have been passionate about helping others learn for as long as I can remember.</p>

	<p>My tutoring journey began in 10th grade, when I started helping classmates 
	through my school’s guidance office. 
	That experience sparked a lifelong love for providing one-on-one learning support.</p>

	<p> I have had the opportunity to work with a wide range of learners: from elementary 
	students in an after-school program, to high school students 
	I tutored weekly, to adults seeking to build confidence with computers and new technology.</p>

	<p>Since graduating college, I have continued tutoring high school students 
	in various areas of mathematics, taught multiple summer camps, and 
	provided personalized tech coaching for adults. Whether it’s a one-time 
	session or ongoing support, I am always excited to meet learners where 
	they are and help them grow.</p>

	<h1>Testimonials</h1>
	<p class = "testimonials">"Erin taught me in 3 weeks what I couldn't learn in a year" - Gabe</p>

	<p class = "testimonials">"Erin really helped me with my math class by breaking down the math problems 
	and going over them with me again and again until I finally understood them. 
	The next test I received a 100% and I could not have done it without her patience 
	with me and knowledge of the subject I was struggling with. She is truly a 
	knowledgeable and dedicated tutor." - Danielle</p>
